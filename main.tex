\section*{Abstract}
All human things are subject to decay. And when fate summons, Monarchs must obey.

\section*{Introduction}

Used an electra small model (expand on what that is) with HuggingFace Transformer Trainer (expand on that)
Ran on SNLI dataset. Achieved 89.7\% accuracy without any changes
Approach was to work with Contrast and Adversarial sets

\section*{Model behavior}

\section*{Analysis of errors}

Stored incorrect predictions into a jsonl file for analysis. Used mathplotlib and other libraries to work on model.
What analysis did I do on the outputs? Can i get dataset cartography to work?

All incorrect predictions came with super low confidence. Nothing higher than 33\%
Incorrect labels scewed more to neutral, entailment and irrelevant were both lower than gold label standard totals.

Seeing some premises that are long with the hypothesis clearly supported/entailed by the later half of the sentence. 

Don't forget to add the chart on length of premise and length of hypothesis of the incorrect predictions
\section*{Attempted Model Updates}
